           <h1>The Grad Planner </h1>
           <p class="indent">...is your best friend.</p>
           <p>
               Of course, the Grad Planner is also a semester by semester chart that creates a list of courses from your declared major, declared minor (if you have one), and any electives required for your degree.
               This list allows you to quickly and easily chart when you intend to take each course.
           </p>
           <p>
               In other words, the Grad Planner will provide the best roadmap for your college career you can have.
               Knowing what courses you intend to take allows you to register quickly, which can save a lot of hassle when everyone wants to take the same courses.
               The Grad Planner also lists whether a certain course is available online or on campus, which can make a signficant difference in what choice you make.
               If your grad plan has been approved, it is far, far easier to apply for graduation when the time comes.

           <h2>Access: </h2>

           <p>
               The Grad Planner can be accessed through I-Plan, the Academic Advising department's official website. I-Plan is full of powerful tools to help students decide on a career path, as well as get the most out of their their time as a student. I-Plan is located here:

           <a class="indent" href="https://iplan.byui.edu/enterprise/login.html">Grad Planner</a>
           <p>I-Plan can also be accessed from the Student tab of your homescreen, under Degree Information. In order to access I-Plan and the Grad Planner, you will be required to login with your BYU-I account information. </p>
           <h2>Play Around</h2>

           <p>
               After you login, explore some of the other options available through I-Plan: Tutoring services, Handshake, or Portfolium. We'll talk about those more later. For now, head to the Grad Planner'
           </p>
           <ul>
               <li>Once you're in, the very first thing you should do is create the simplest Grad Plan for your major that you can. That could be 12 credit hours each semester, or it could be anything else. More than 15-16 credits a semester is not recommended.</li>
               <li>Remember that some courses have prerequisites that must be taken before you can take them. Plan as many prerequisites as possible early, so that you have options if a class isn't available when you planned it. </li>
               <li>Try to balance your religion, general education and major required classes so that you don't burn out on a single topic. It can be very helpful and uplifting to take a break from programming and read the scriptures, or learn about natural disasters</li>
               <li>After creating a straightforward plan, try creating a few alternate plans. Look at minor options. Consider what it would take to graduate in three years. Or two! ( Don't try it! We want you to spend as much time getting ready for a career as you need.)</li>
           </ul>
           <h2>Finalize</h2>
           <p>
               After you've decided on which plan you want, click the 'Validate' button under the My Plan section of the site.<br>
               If there are any issues with the plan you've declared, the program will present you with a notification. If there aren't any, your plan will be submitted to an advisor for approval.
